===
<kbd>![LFAC Logo](/screenshot/LFAC-repo-card.png)</kbd>

Script to automate Linux logs & artifacts collection. It uses built-in tools to automate the collection of systems artifacts. It was created to facilitate data collection, and depend less on remote tools/agents during incident response engagements.

Features
===
- Collecting logs from: 
  - user & root .bash_history
  - user & root cron/crontab
  - ifconfig/ip addr
  - netstat
  - ps aux
  - `/var/log`
  - `/tmp`
- Checking mechanism - to see if `net-tools` is installed. if not, script will install it. <b>hopefully..</b> \*sigh\*
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 10 & RedHat 8.4.

Dependencies
===
<li>net-tools - networking utilities for Linux</li>

How to Run
===
 - Copy LFAC.sh your host machine
 - Give execution permission by running `chmod +x LFAC.sh`
 - Then run the script as below:
```
  $ sudo ./LFAC.sh
```
- Wait until it finished collecting the logs
- The compressed logs should located at `/opt/` dir named as <'hostname'>.tar.gz
